# t3tr15.github.io
A Tetris variant made by two bois. What more is there to say? Quite a bit, actually...

# Key binding
Key binding for tetriminos is based off of those found in Tetris Friends (see https://i.redd.it/5yj1ehsbxfu21.png), with additional WASD keys which correspond to the arrow keys. However, there are also additional keyboard controls, which are covered below.

# VFX settings
* U - Minimal VFX. Turns off particles and rotation of the screen.
* I - Low VFX. No particles, but screen rotates based on the keys you press.
* O - Medium VFX. Low VFX + basic particles.
* P - Maximum VFX. A combination of basic particles and text, which displays your combo and follows the basic particles.

# Rotation
This variant of Tetris allows you to rotate your tetriminos at custom angles. (Highly not recommended, but a feature because why not?)
* Q - Subtracts 45 degrees from the angle that the tetrimino is being rotated (default is 90 degrees, minimum is 45 degrees).
* E - Adds 45 degrees to the angle that the tetrimino is being rotated (maximum is 180 degrees).

# Restarting the game
Although the game auto-detects if the board is full, you can still reset your board and tetrimonos by pressing R.

# That's all there is.
