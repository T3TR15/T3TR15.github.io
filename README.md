Tetris variant made by two bois. What more is there to say?

# Key binding
Key binding for tetriminos is based off of those found in Tetris Friends (see https://i.redd.it/5yj1ehsbxfu21.png), with additional WASD keys which correspond to the arrow keys. However, there are also additional VFX settings which can be set by the keyboard.

# VFX settings
* U - Minimal VFX. Turns off particles and rotation of the screen.
* I - Low VFX. No particles, but screen rotates based on the keys you press.
* O - Medium VFX. Low VFX + basic particles.
* P - Maximum VFX. A combination of basic particles and text, which displays your combo and follows the basic particles.

# That's all there is.
